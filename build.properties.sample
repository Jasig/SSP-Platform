#==================== File and Directory Names ========================

##### Replace server.home with the location of Tomcat 6 on your machine #####
# path to tomcat binaries
server.home=@server.home@

# path to tomcat servlet container (defaults to same directory as the tomcat binaries)
server.base=${server.home}

# path to webapps directory (defaults to /webapps under the tomcat path)
server.webapps=${server.base}/webapps

# If the mvn executable isn't on your path you can set the location here or set it on your path.
#maven.home=

######## uPortal Data ######## 

# Use default_entities.location to override the location of data imported by the initdb 
# and/or db-import targets;  required data is imported before entities specified here
#default_entities.location=uportal-war/src/main/data/default_entities

# Use quickstart_entities.location to override the location of data imported by the initdb 
# and/or db-import targets;  required and default data is imported before entities specified here
#quickstart_entities.location=uportal-war/src/main/data/ssp_entities


######## Deployment Configuration ##########
# The following apply to deployPortletApp, deploy-war, and deploy-ear targets

# Should the deployment tools extract the WARs when copying them into the servlet container 
extractWars=true

# Should the existing webapp be removed before deploying the new webapp
removeExisting=true

# The following applies to the clean and deploy-ear targets.
# Should the shared library location have all existing files removed when clean is run.
# NOTE: Tomcat 6.0 does not include any libraries in shared/lib by default so as long as
#       all required libraries are declared in the uportal-ear it is ok to set this to true.
cleanShared=true

# Prompt the user before running ant tasks that could modify the database
prodPrompt=false
