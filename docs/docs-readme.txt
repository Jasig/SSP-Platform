Hey!  Where's the documentation?

SSP is documented in it's wiki: https://wiki.jasig.org/display/SSP/Home

SSP-Platform is based on uPortal which is documented in its wiki and its manual, not here in source control.

uPortal manual:
http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/UPM31/Home

(Note: as of this writing the manual is a work in progress.  
Your patience is appreciated, and your contributions would be most welcome.)
